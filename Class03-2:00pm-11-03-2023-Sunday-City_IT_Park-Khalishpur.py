# Discussion about polymorphism in python, type casting--> type conversion
# polymorphism : doing same work in different ways ( multiple ways )

#array ---> all programming languages have array but python has list (one kind of array)

# casting ---> conversion from one data type to another data type(eg. str to int) or conversion
